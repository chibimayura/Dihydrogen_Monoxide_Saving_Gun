# Dihydrogen_Monoxide_Saving_Gun
OpenCV detecting where your mouth is and shoots water if mouth is open and vice versa

## Concept
When I was working in retail, I had a regular customer that comes in all the time. One day he looked a bit distressed from usual. He told me his story that he was a veteran and has been having a difficult time making ends met. His homelessness made it difficult for him to receive his benefits and rehab from his addiction. He has been struggling to try to get a job due to not having a permanent address. 
I wanted to make an app with the concept of helping someone rehabilitate from drugs they possibly felt ashame of from being hooked onto and preventing them from functioning a normal life. This was a small beginning of learning OpenCV and facial recognition in two days at Minerva Hackathon 2019. The concept of creating a water gun to put out cigarettes stemmed from a manga I read in my youth where a young kid puts out the cigarette of a deliquent who rolled down their window to mock them.
